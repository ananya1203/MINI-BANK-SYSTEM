# Project Statement -- Mini Banking Simulation System

## Problem Statement

Traditional banking software is often too complex for beginners learning
programming concepts. There is a need for a simple, interactive, and
educational banking system that simulates essential financial operations
such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiry.
The system should be easy to run, understand, and modify for learning
purposes.

## Scope of the Project

-   To create a simplified banking simulation system using Python.
-   The project will focus on fundamental operations only.
-   It will run entirely in a command-line or Jupyter Notebook
    environment.
-   No real financial transactions or database integration are included.
-   The system is intended purely for academic, demonstration, and
    learning purposes.

## Target Users

-   First-year college students learning Python.
-   Beginners practicing conditional logic, loops, and functions.
-   Teachers and mentors creating basic programming assignments.
-   Anyone needing a simple demonstration of how banking operations
    work.

## High-Level Features

-   User account creation with basic details.
-   Deposit functionality with input validation.
-   Withdrawal functionality with balance checking.
-   Balance inquiry to display current account status.
-   Interactive text-based menu for smooth navigation.
-   Error handling for invalid or unexpected inputs.
